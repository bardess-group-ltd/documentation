### Ingestion from Kafka to Source

The code is designed to automate the process of reading, decoding, and processing Solifi data from Kafka in a secure and dynamic way. This new code is created to stream the data from kafka directly into databricks and processing the data instantenously into bronze tables. Here are some key highlights of the process:

1.  **Dynamic Configuration**: The script adjusts its behavior based on the specified environment ("Production" or "UAT"), and topics allowing it to be reused across multiple environments and topics without manual modifications.
    
2.  **Secure Data Handling**: Sensitive credentials, such as API keys and secrets, are securely retrieved using Databricks' secret management, ensuring data integrity and security.
    
3.  **Real-Time Data Processing**: The script sets up a real-time data processing pipeline that consumes messages from Kafka topics, decodes them using a schema registry, and stores the processed data in a structured Delta Lake table in Unity Catalog.
    
4.  **Fault Tolerance**: By using a checkpoint directory, the script ensures that the stream resumes processing from the correct position after a failure, avoiding data duplication or loss. Checkpoint in the process, allows the ability to manually reset to a period of time in the event of unforseen data loss.
    
5.  **Audit Logging**: Keeps track of the active streaming jobs and their configurations in an audit table, helping in monitoring and auditing the streaming activities.

6.	**Unity Catalog**: The process utilizes Databricks Unity Catalog, resulting in changes to database, schema names and storage location to S3. 
    

### Summary

*   **Technical Perspective**: The script sets up a robust Spark Structured Streaming job that interacts with Kafka, decodes Avro messages using a schema registry, and writes to Delta Lake tables, ensuring security and fault tolerance using Databricks' secret management and checkpointing.
    
*   **Non-Technical Perspective**: This code automates the real-time processing of data streams, adapting to different environments and ensuring data security, reliability, and traceability.
