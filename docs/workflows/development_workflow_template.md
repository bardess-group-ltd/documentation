This document explains the development workflow for [Organization Name].

## Workflow Overview

We use **GitHub Flow** for managing development. Here's a brief overview of the process:

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository
1. **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

### 2. Create a Branch
Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Make Changes and Commit
Make your changes and commit them:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add new feature description"
```

### 4. Push Changes
Push the changes to your fork:
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 5. Open a Pull Request
Go to the repository on GitHub and open a **Pull Request** from your branch. The PR will be reviewed by a team member before being merged.

### 6. Code Review and Merge
Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the `main` branch.

## Code Reviews

- Code must be reviewed by at least one team member.
- Ensure all unit tests pass before merging.
